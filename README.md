# Challenge Project #1

## Description

- My main motivation for completing this project was to gain more proficiency using github and coding in HTML and CSS.
- I built this project to create a more accessable website for people with disabilities.
- For this project I added a lot of accessable attributes to the prexisting website. I added alt attributes to all of the images, made sure links worked   properly, made sure headings were in sequential order, and made sure the page overall was in a logical order and format.
- Doing this project I learned how to fix broken links, how to reformat html code to be in sequential order and how to make a webpage more accessable.

## Usage

Badges aren't necessary, but they demonstrate street cred. Badges let other developers know that you know what you're doing. Check out the badges hosted by [shields.io](https://shields.io/). You may not understand what they all represent now, but you will in time.

## Features

If your project has a lot of features, list them here.

## How to Contribute

If you created an application or package and would like other developers to contribute to it, you can include guidelines for how to do so. The [Contributor Covenant](https://www.contributor-covenant.org/) is an industry standard, but you can always write your own if you'd prefer.

## Tests

Go the extra mile and write tests for your application. Then provide examples on how to run them here.
