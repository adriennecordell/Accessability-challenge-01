# Challenge Project #1

## Description
-This project is all about acessability. The number one goal was making the website easier for others to use, in doing so this project helped me become     more fluent in my coding skills and really fine-tune my ability to read and execute code.
- My main motivation for completing this project was to gain more proficiency using github and coding in HTML and CSS.
- I built this project to create a more accessable website for people with disabilities.
- For this project I added a lot of accessable attributes to the prexisting website. I added alt attributes to all of the images, made sure links worked   properly, made sure headings were in sequential order, and made sure the page overall was in a logical order and format.
- Doing this project I learned how to fix broken links, how to reformat html code to be in sequential order and how to make a webpage more accessable.

## Usage
To get the full potiential this website has to offer, click on any one of the three links at the top-right of the webpage, this will drop you down to that particuliar section. Please refer to screenshots below for visual instructions.

## Credits

This project would not be possible without the starter code for the website. As a beginner web developer, I have minimal understanding of these coding languages. The starter code allowed me to focus on particular challenges and fixes while looking at already executed code to help guide me.

I will also have to give credit to all the wonderful people on slack that have been so kind as to respond to questions and help me solve problems.
